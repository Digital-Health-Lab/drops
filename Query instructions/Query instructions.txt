There are the instructions.

Option one:

1. Log in to the server through Putty. Please see section 3 in the handover document.

2. Log in to the database. Please see section 7.3 in the handover document

3. Run the query as below. Please see the attached screen shots for both results

To find all the participants aged >40 across all studies

db.participant.find({age:{$gt: 40}}).toArray()


To find all the step count data of all â€˜femalesâ€™ aged >40 in all my studies

db.step_count.aggregate([
	{ $lookup:
		{
			from: "participant",
			localField: "participantId",
			foreignField: "participantId",
			as: "participant"
		}
	},
	{ $unwind: "$participant"
	},
	{ $lookup:
		{
			from: "study",
			localField: "participant.studyId",
			foreignField: "studyId",
			as: "study"
		}
	},
	{ $unwind: "$study"
	},
	{ $match: {"study.userId": 5, "participant.age": {$gt: 40}, "participant.gender": "F"}},
	{ $project:
		{
			_id: 0,
			"participant.age": 1,
			"participant.gender": 1,
			participantId : 1,
			sourceId: 1,
			measuredAt: 1,
			steps: 1,
			xAxis: 1,
			yAxis: 1,
			zAxis: 1,
			variableName: 1,
			variableValue: 1,
			addData: 1,
			createdAt: 1,
			updatedAt: 1
		}
	}
]).toArray()

Option two:

I will generally use Excel and Access to link and query imported dataset.

1. Download the dataset from website

2. Open 3 .csv files in Excel and save them as 3 .xlsx files

3. Create a blank database from Access and open it

4. External Data -> New Data Source -> From File -> Excel, and browse the .xlsx files you just created, and then click OK

5. Next -> Tick off 'First Row Contains Column Headings' and Next -> Next -> Next -> Finish

6. Repeat above step 4 and 5 for the other two .xlsx files

7. Now you will see 3 tables on the left menu (please ignore the default table named 'Table1')

8. Database Tools -> Relationships -> add those 3 tables in

9. Link Study and Participant tables by studyId, and link Participant and Step_count tables by participantId

10. Create -> Query Wizard - Simple Wuery Wizard -> choose what ever fields you want to include from each table. -> Next -> Next -> Finish

11. You will see Participant Query tab now -> Right click on this tab, and go to Design View

12. On Criteria row, add >40 in the age column, and add F in the gender column.

13. Click on Run on the top left menu.

14. You will get your preferred results.
